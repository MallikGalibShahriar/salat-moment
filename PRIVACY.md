# Privacy Policy

**Salat Moment** was built with a simple principle: **Your data belongs to you.**

We do not track you, sell your data, or clutter your experience with ads. Here is exactly how the extension handles your information.

## 1. What We Know About You
**Nothing.**
We do not have servers that store your personal information. We don't know who you are.

## 2. How Location Works
To give you accurate prayer times, the extension needs to know where you are.
- **Your Coordinates:** When you allow permissions, your browser finds your approximate location (latitude/longitude) locally.
- **Where it goes:** This location is sent *directly* from your browser to the [Aladhan API](https://aladhan.com/) purely to get the prayer schedule. We do not see or save this data.
- **Storage:** The calculated times are saved **on your own computer** (in Chrome's local storage) so the extension works fast.

## 3. Third Parties
We use trusted public services to make the app work:
- **Aladhan API:** For prayer time calculations.
- **IP-API:** As a backup to find your city if GPS is disabled.

## 4. Your Control
You are in charge.
- You can turn off location permissions in your browser settings at any time.
- You can uninstall the extension to instantly wipe all local data it created.
